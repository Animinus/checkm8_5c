# checkm8_5c
Refactoring the checkm8 exploit and testing it on specifically the iPhone 5C

All I am doing is refactoring the checkm8 exploit by axi0mx, porting it to Python 3.7 and making it specifically for the iPhone 5C.

Planning on using this to explore the iPhone 5C boot sequence, understand the phone and possibly try and see if I could turn into a jailbreak?
